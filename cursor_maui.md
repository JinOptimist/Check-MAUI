I'll pick up from setting up Android tooling and get the app to build and run on Android. First I'll check your .NET SDK/workloads and whether Android SDK tools are present, then install what's missing, accept licenses, create/start an emulator, and run the app.

Now I'll run the initial environment checks.

I'll check installed .NET SDKs and workloads, and detect Android SDK/ADB availability.

I’m splitting the checks into separate PowerShell commands compatible with your shell. Now I’ll run them sequentially.


I'll search for the necessary winget packages for Android SDK tools and JDK 17, then install them if found, set ANDROID_SDK_ROOT, and install platforms/build-tools with sdkmanager.

I verified .NET SDK and MAUI workload. Next I'll install JDK 17 and Android Studio to provide SDK tools, then set ANDROID_SDK_ROOT and proceed with SDK components.

I’m going to detect whether the Android SDK is already present and locate tools like sdkmanager, avdmanager, emulator, and adb. If found, I’ll set ANDROID_SDK_ROOT for this session. Then I’ll proceed to install required SDK components.

I'll search winget for Android Platform Tools and command-line tools packages to install SDK components non-interactively.
